    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula 1 (a.k.a. F1 or Formula One) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word \"formula\" in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of all information on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, championships from 1950 till the latest 2021 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Hybird Era?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2014-2021\n",
    "\n",
    "The year 2014 ushered in the most significant rule changes in F1 history, with normally aspirated, 2.4-liter V8 engines replaced by new, 1.6-liter turbocharged V6 “power units” (no longer officially called engines) integrated with complex, hybrid energy recovery systems (ERS) that FIA claimed “gave the sport a much cleaner and greener image more relevant to developing road car technologies.”&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "The new formula allows turbocharged engines, which last appeared in 1988. These have their efficiency improved through turbo-compounding by recovering energy from exhaust gases. The original proposal for four-cylinder turbocharged engines was not welcomed by the racing teams, in particular Ferrari. A compromise was reached, allowing V6 forced induction engines instead. The engines rarely exceed 12,000 rpm during qualifying and race, due to the new fuel flow restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy recovery systems such as KERS had a boost of 160 hp (120 kW) and 2 megajoules per lap. KERS was renamed Motor Generator Unit–Kinetic (MGU-K). Heat energyrecovery systems were also allowed, under the name Motor Generator Unit–Heat (MGU-H)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2015 season was an improvement on 2014, adding about 30–50 hp (20–40 kW) to most engines, the Mercedes engine being the most powerful with 870 hp (649 kW). In 2019, Renault's engine was claimed to have hit 1,000 hp in qualifying trim.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, the FIA began negotiations with existing constructors and potential new manufacturers over the next generation of engines with a projected introduction date of 2021 but delayed to 2022 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial proposal was designed to simplify engine designs, cut costs, promote new entries and address criticisms directed at the 2014 generation of engines. It called for the 1.6 L V6 configuration to be retained, but abandoned the complex Motor Generator Unit–Heat (MGU-H) system. The Motor Generator Unit–Kinetic (MGU-K) would be more powerful, with a greater emphasis on driver deployment and a more flexible introduction to allow for tactical use.&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposal also called for the introduction of standardised components and design parameters to make components produced by all manufacturers compatible with one another in a system dubbed \"plug in and play\". A further proposal to allow four-wheel drive cars was also made, with the front axle driven by an MGU-K unit—as opposed to the traditional driveshaft—that functioned independently of the MGU-K providing power to the rear axle, mirroring the system developed by Porsche for the 919 Hybrid race car.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, mostly due to no engine supplier applying for F1 entry in 2021 and 2022, abolishment of the MGU-H, a more powerful MGU-K and a four-wheel drive system were all shelved with the possibility of their re-introduction for 2026. Instead, the teams and FIA agreed to a radical change in body/chassis aerodynamics to promote more battles on the course at closer distances to each other. They further agreed to an increase in alcohol content from 5.75% to 10% of fuel, and to implement a freeze on power unit design for 2022-2025, with the ICE, turbocharger and MGU-H being frozen on March 1st and the energy store, MGU-K and control electronics being frozen on September 1st during the 2022 season. Honda, the outgoing engine supplier in 2021, was keen to keep the MGU-H, and Red Bull, who took over the engine production project, backed that opinion. The 4WD system was planned to be based on Porsche 919 Hybrid system, but Porsche ended up not becoming an F1 engine supplier for 2021-2022."

    "### How to run the code\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an executable [*Jupyter notebook*](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian.ml](https://www.jovian.ml), a platform for sharing data science projects. You can run and experiment with the code in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your own computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Add Conda binaries to your system `PATH`, so you can use the `conda` command on your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a Conda environment and install the required libraries by running these commands on the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n zerotopandas -y python=3.8 \n",
    "conda activate zerotopandas\n",
    "pip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opendatasets --upgrade\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Press the \"Clone\" button above to copy the command for downloading the notebook, and run it on the terminal. This will create a new directory and download the notebook. The command will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jovian clone notebook-owner/notebook-id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Enter the newly created directory using `cd directory-name` and start the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser. Click on the notebook file (it has a `.ipynb` extension) to open it.\n"
